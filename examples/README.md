# Examples

## Overview

- ex1: Uses MIT licensed corpora and G2P rules from the 2020 study project. Processing is fast.

- ex2: Uses corpora from ex1 plus more corpora which are downloaded, and newer G2P rules. Takes quite a while to process.

## Running

The examples have been tested on Linux and Windows on x86_64 architecture using Docker. 
Please check the comments in the "Dockerfile" of each example to see how the container is build and how to run the processing.
